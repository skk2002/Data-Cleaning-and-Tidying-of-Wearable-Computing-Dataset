Project Title
"Data Cleaning and Tidying of Wearable Computing Dataset"

Overview
This project involves cleaning and processing a dataset from the UCI location based on human activity recognition using smartphones. It combines training and testing data, extracts relevant measurements, and creates a tidy dataset.

Requirements
R version 3.5 or higher
R packages: dplyr


How to Run the Code
Ensure the UCI HAR Dataset is extracted in your working directory.
Open R or RStudio.
Source the run_analysis.R script.
The tidy dataset will be saved as tidy_data.txt in your working directory.


Structure of the Repository
run_analysis.R: Script that performs data cleaning and processing.
CodeBook.md: Describes the variables and the cleaning steps performed.
tidy_data.txt: The final tidy dataset for analysis.
